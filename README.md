# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection

This repository contains code and Dataset for detecting Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on binary classification to identify the presence or absence of Parkinson's Disease based on relevant features.

Key Features:-

High-Performance Algorithm: Utilizes the XGBoost classifier, known for its superior performance and accuracy in binary classification tasks.

Non-Linearity Handling: Addresses non-linear relationships within the data, ensuring the model captures complex patterns.

Imbalanced Data Management: Handles class imbalance, a common challenge in medical datasets, using specialized techniques to ensure fair representation of both classes.

Feature Importance Analysis: Provides insights into the importance of various features, aiding in feature selection and engineering.

Scalable and Efficient: Optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for large datasets and real-time applications.

Requirements

Python 3.6+

Libraries used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn, imbalanced-learn
